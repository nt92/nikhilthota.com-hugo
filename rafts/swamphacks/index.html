    <article class="post_content">
        
        <p>Last week, I went back to The University of Florida (UF) to recruit and represent Facebook as a corporate sponsor for 
<a href="https://2020.swamphacks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SwampHacks</a> (UF’s premier hackathon). As a former organizer of the event during my stint as a student, I was left feeling both humility and pride, seeing how far SwampHacks has come. During the 
<a href="https://2017.swamphacks.com/team.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early years</a> of the event, we were lucky to have 200 attendees and had to basically beg sponsors to recognize the event as legitimate. A 
<a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-162103925/views-from-the-swamp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>fire</em> mixtape</a> helped us get pretty far though! At SwampHacks 2020 however, there were over 600 hackers, with corporate representation (and $$$) from all sides of the industry.</p>
<p>It was fascinating being on the other side of the symbiotic, but delicate recruiter-student relationship. I was initially a bit disoriented but that faded away into awe as I realized how impressively earnest and determined so many of the students were. From budding healthcare entrepreneurs to future PhDs in cryptography, SwampHacks attracted them all, and the ambition was palpable.</p>
<p>From my freshly minted 6-months-in-the-working-world wisdom, I see that the further one gets in their career, the easier it is to forget the things that inspired them to pursue technology in the first place. For a lot of these hackers (myself included), this inspiration partly comes from the realization that you create almost anything you heart desires with nothing more than a laptop and some gumption. I could see the illumination in the eyes of these students, and being in that environment was a powerful reminder to stay curious and inquisitive.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>sponsoring a questionable ‘spicy ramen challenge’ and handing out dank facebook swag</li>
<li>giving a tech talk on the fundamentals and history of react.js</li>
<li>interacting with hundreds of students throughout the weekend and sharing my fledgling experience at facebook</li>
<li>mentoring hackers who were learning a new language / paradigm from scratch</li>
<li>petting some really cute and friendly therapy dogs</li>
</ul>
