   Hey everyone. Before we get into this, I am not a medical professional (sorry dad). Everything that I&amp;rsquo;ve written here is based on personal experience and publicly available information. If you&amp;rsquo;re considering doing an extended fast, do your own research. ‚úåüèΩ
 A couple of months ago, my marathon-running-roommate Kenton convinced me, my other roommate Tyler, and my girlfriend Mack to attempt a 72 hour fast with him.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Reading</title>

      <description>Books are incredible. They&amp;rsquo;re even better when you can get them for free. However, one thing that I struggle with is figuring out what to read with the vast quantity of options available. One thing that has helped me is segmenting my reading into buckets based on the medium of consumption.
What does that mean? Today, there are more ways to read a book than to just buy a physical tome and read it cover-to-cover.</description>

      <title>The Sun and The Clouds</title>

      <description>Imagine that we live where it&amp;#39;s always cloudy. We never see the sun. And we, of course, take our everyday experience as if it&amp;#39;s reality‚Äîthe only reality. The clouds are perhaps a little claustrophobic in some vague way but they&amp;#39;re comfortable and familiar. One day we meet a visitor who tells us that what we&amp;#39;re used to isn&amp;#39;t the whole story, that there&amp;#39;s something else. Curious, we go with him, and he guides us up a mountain.</description>

      <description>Growing up we were taught that the Fire Nation was the greatest civilization in history. And somehow the war was our way of sharing our greatness with the rest of the world. What an amazing lie that was. The people of the world are terrified by the Fire Nation. They don&amp;#39;t see our greatness ‚Äî They hate us! And we deserve it. We created an era of fear in the world.</description>

      <description>havin&amp;rsquo; fun ain&amp;rsquo;t hard&amp;hellip; if you got a library card
  August 21st, 2019 was an interesting day for me. It was an average wednesday, except that I had just gotten an audiobook copy of When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi. Being the 2x playback speed fiend that I am, I made it to the end in a couple of days and found myself tearing up in the gym in between sets of incline bench press.</description>

      <description>15808 NW 90th Street, Alachua, Florida, 32615 ‚Äî The Temple of the Universe
  Nested in the thicket of North Florida&amp;rsquo;s wilderness, about a 30 minute drive from the University of Florida, is the Temple of the Universe. The temple is a spiritual sanctuary where &amp;lsquo;men and women of any religion or set of beliefs can come together to experience the love, peace, and bliss which exists within all beings.</description>

      <description>A few months ago, I applied to the Interact Fellowship, but unfortunately got rejected shortly after. The application essays however, were incredibly insightful and posed a lot of interesting questions that I found myself thinking a lot about. I wanted to share my ramblings for some of these questions because I think that they tell a lot about who I am as a person. Shoutout to Kenton for the idea.</description>

      <description>It‚Äôs February, and I have a yearning to finally finish this piece. I‚Äôve been putting it off for so long, but it‚Äôs time that I actually attempt to press some keys and create some prose. This is a topic I feel is especially relevant these days as I‚Äôve been having interesting conversations and thoughts about money and the value of frugality. If my first several months into the world of true financial independence as a fully fledged ‚Äòadult‚Äô is any signal, I am¬†obsessed¬†with saving money.</description>

      <title>From Hacker to... Benefactor?</title>

      <description>Last week, I went back to The University of Florida (UF) to recruit and represent Facebook as a corporate sponsor for SwampHacks (UF‚Äôs premier hackathon). As a former organizer of the event during my stint as a student, I was left feeling both humility and pride, seeing how far SwampHacks has come. During the early years of the event, we were lucky to have 200 attendees and had to basically beg sponsors to recognize the event as legitimate.</description>

      <description>Lactose Intolerance [¬†lak-tohs in-tol-er-uh ns ] /¬†noun¬†‚Äî a digestive disorder caused by the inability to digest lactose, a main carbohydrate in dairy products, which can lead to a¬†negative effect on quality of life. A very common disorder, with some groups estimated to have a¬†79%¬†rate of affliction.
 It was a lovely, brisk Sunday evening in Seattle. Autumn was imminent, so the leaves had recently shifted to a more varied palette of rustic earth tones.</description>

      <description>I recently finished Matthew Walker‚Äôs Why We Sleep, a New York Times Bestseller which has been exploding in the productivity-obsessed circles that I‚Äôm a part of. For good reason too ‚Äî this book distills the vast amount of modern sleep research over the past 20 years into one main idea: sleep is¬†really¬†important. In the past year or so, I‚Äôve been experimenting with everything in the sleep-improvement space, from blackout curtains to melatonin to timing my caffeine consumption (all of these being small but integral pieces of the puzzle).</description>

   Travel, like life, is a marathon and not a race ‚Äî somebody  Globalism, smartphones, and balance. These were my topics of musing and reflection during my summer travels. I spent almost¬†2 months,¬†in between my college graduation at the University of Florida and full-time employment at Facebook, bouncing between Europe and Southeast Asia with just a backpack. This somewhat-solo trip was unlike anything I‚Äôd ever done before, and as I‚Äôve settled into a stable groove here in San Francisco, I‚Äôd like to unpack some of the personal¬†and¬†more broad-reaching insights I‚Äôve gleaned.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: I was going to write this as a satire piece poking fun at the wanderlust travel subculture but after this adventure, I genuinely feel like there‚Äôs something for me to explore in writing, so instead I am going to try and earnestly distill my experience into useful substance.
 Pai is an¬†interesting¬†place, to say the least. Twenty years ago, the remote village in northern Thailand was nothing more than a small outpost inhabited by a few indigenous groups, sewn together by mountains, rice fields, and the flourishing Pai river.</description>

      <description>A few months ago at a random Chinatown bar in New York City, Tyler Richards¬†and I were having a conversation about journaling. I told him that I had over 4¬†years¬†worth of consistent journal entries and Tyler, being the data-minded person he is, gave me an idea to reinforce the lessons and insights from these journaling sessions.
The Idea: A system that emails me a random journal entry every day so I could see exactly what was going on in my mind at that given time.</description>

      <description>This summer, I will be taking the quintessential millennial post-graduation pilgrimage to Southeast Asia for about two months. I wanted to optimize my travel experience as much as possible and this involves traveling with no luggage other than a backpack. I‚Äôve spent a lot of time these past months procrastinating on school responsibilities by planning out this trip and along the way have learned a few things about efficient and intentional travel which I‚Äôd like to share.</description>
