      <description>A few months ago at a random Chinatown bar in New York City, Tyler Richards and I were having a conversation about journaling. I told him that I had over 4 years worth of consistent journal entries and Tyler, being the data-minded person he is, gave me an idea to reinforce the lessons and insights from these journaling sessions.
The Idea: A system that emails me a random journal entry every day so I could see exactly what was going on in my mind at that given time.</description>
