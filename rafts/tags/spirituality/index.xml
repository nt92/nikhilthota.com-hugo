      <description>Imagine that we live where it&amp;#39;s always cloudy. We never see the sun. And we, of course, take our everyday experience as if it&amp;#39;s reality—the only reality. The clouds are perhaps a little claustrophobic in some vague way but they&amp;#39;re comfortable and familiar. One day we meet a visitor who tells us that what we&amp;#39;re used to isn&amp;#39;t the whole story, that there&amp;#39;s something else. Curious, we go with him, and he guides us up a mountain.</description>

      <description>15808 NW 90th Street, Alachua, Florida, 32615 — The Temple of the Universe
  Nested in the thicket of North Florida&amp;rsquo;s wilderness, about a 30 minute drive from the University of Florida, is the Temple of the Universe. The temple is a spiritual sanctuary where &amp;lsquo;men and women of any religion or set of beliefs can come together to experience the love, peace, and bliss which exists within all beings.</description>
