> *Hey everyone. Before we get into this, **I am not a medical professional**. Everything that I've written in this article is based on personal experience and publicly available information. If you're considering doing an extended fast, do your own research.* ✌🏽

A couple of months ago, my marathon-running-roommate Kenton convinced me, my other roommate Tyler, and my girlfriend Mack to attempt a 72 hour fast with him. I'd been curious for a while but wanted to start with 24 hours and eventually work my way up to a full three days. Nope. With just a few notches of Intermittent Fasting on my belt, I threw myself into the inferno.

If you’re like me and want to just get a quick tl;dr checklist on how to fast, I’ve got one for you at the bottom of this piece! To go right to it, [click here.](#fasting-checklist)

## What is Fasting?

**Fasting is not consuming calories for a certain amount of time**. There are a few common approaches that are now widely used & researched.

- *Intermittent Fasting (IF)* is a daily practice of time-restricted feeding in which you segment your day into (1) a fasting window in which you do not eat and (2) a feeding window in which you eat what you normally would. Common cadences for IF are 16:8 (16 hours fasting, 8 hours feeding), 20:4, and even 23:1 (one-meal-a-day).
- *Extended Fasting* is an episodic practice in which you restrict feeding for a longer time. Whereas IF is a daily practice, this is one that could be done every few months or so. The length and frequency are up to you, and you can learn more about the physiology at each stage of the fast [here](https://www.zerofasting.com/the-physiology-of-fasting/).

This post will primarily cover my experience with an extended fast but I also intermittent fast with a 16:8 cadence most days. You can weave in pieces of both approaches into your lifestyle since they both provide numerous benefits to lifespan, healthspan[^1], and wellbeing.

## Why Fast?

Everybody has their own motivations for fasting. I'm personally interested in the longevity and health benefits, which have stood the tests of time *and* scientific scrutiny.

So what are the benefits? There are many new research findings coming out at the time of writing this with regards to the complex psychological & biophysical changes involved, but here are some things that I could understand as a layman.

1. **Fat Loss**: This one is obvious. Since you're not consuming any calories, your body needs to expend its resources to survive. Carbs & glucose are short-lived so we're left with fat and muscle. It's inefficient and counterproductive to guzzle down muscle mass, so your body instead consumes stores of fat and old, dysfunctional cells. Your body even ramps up [HGH production](https://www.dietdoctor.com/fasting-and-growth-hormone) to prevent muscle loss.
2. **Ketosis & More Energy**: As you enter a fasted state, your body begins to produce ketones by breaking down fat stores. These serve as a kind of backup battery of energy in addition to glucose. Many people [anecdotally](https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/6parcc/why_do_i_have_so_much_energy_now/) report higher energy levels, mental sharpness, and general wellbeing once they've adjusted to this state.
3. **Anti-Inflammatory**: By reducing inflammation-causing cells in the blood (called [monoclytes](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/fasting-can-help-ease-inflammation-in-the-body)), fasting has been shown to reduce inflammation[^2] in the body.
4. **Steady Blood Sugar**: Since fasting pushes your body to prefer fat to carbs or glucose, insulin production decreases. Over time, your body becomes more sensitive to insulin which can lead to more stable blood sugar and less crashes (which is something we can all relate to after eating a sugary dessert).
5. **Neurodegenerative Disease Protection**: By fighting metabolic syndrome, reducing excessive inflammation, and optimizing neuron health, fasting has been shown to reduce or prevent the onset of [neurodegenerative diseases](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6836141/) like Alzheimer's and Dementia.
6. **Autophagy**: When your body is fed, cellular growth & division proliferate. When it is fasted however, the body begins an evolutionary process known as [autophagy](https://www.healthline.com/health/autophagy) (literally meaning cellular self-eating). Your body removes old, dysfunctional, potentially cancerous cells[^3] and recycles them for cell repair and cleaning.
7. **Longevity**: Through some magical combination of these benefits and lower risk of many diseases (or some mechanism we don't understand yet), fasting seems to be one of the most surefire ways to live a [longer and healthier life](https://www.heart.org/en/news/2019/11/25/regular-fasting-could-lead-to-longer-healthier-life).

So yeah, there's a lot of reasons to pay attention and give fasting a closer inspection. However, there is no such thing as a silver bullet in nutrition. Fasting isn't right for everybody, especially if you're diabetic, have chronic disease, are considered an elder or a child, or are within a few years of giving birth.[^4] Okay this is starting to sound like the end of a [viagra commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBmn9dg-fw8).

**If you have any concerns, talk to a doctor to be sure.** 🥼

📝 *A note on voluntary suffering. One of my deep convictions is that voluntary suffering makes us better, stronger, and more resilient. I'm not advocating masochism, but the body is inherently [antifragile](https://fs.blog/2014/04/antifragile-a-definition/) and grows from acute stressors — just think about weightlifting and vaccines. In my eyes, fasting is no different and signals to your body that it's time to step its game up.*

## The Objections

Shortly after the fast while feasting on [Souvla](https://www.souvla.com/), Kenton and I had a conversation with someone about fasting. We told her about the experience along with some bits and bobs of research that we had done beforehand, but realized just how many gaps there were in our understanding. She was clearly unconvinced and shrugged it off as another *fad diet*[^5], which left me skeptical myself.

I had a lot of random, unsubstantiated facts and anecdotal knowledge floating around but I couldn't clearly articulate why this could be a healthy lifestyle choice or why I decided to do it. Of course, it's not for everybody but there must be some reason that many are so passionate about it.

> *"Uhh.... it uhh.. helps you live longer, since glycogen is gone and then ketones are good for you plus like autophagy to eat your cells for cancer and stuff."*

{{< figure src="/article_images/fasting/souvla.jpg" >}}

This is one of the main reasons why I decided to write this piece — I wanted to explore the research, understand for myself how fasting works, and tie the science into my experience deep in the trenches of hunger. In the next section, I'm going over some of the common objections that I've had or heard and will attempt to shed some light on them.

**Fasting is just a fad diet**

It is true that fasting has seen a resurgence recently in the public eye due to a confluence of cultural factors. However, societies have been employing it for [thousands of years](https://www.targethealth.com/post/short-history-of-fasting). Various religions have used it as a physical and spiritual cleanse, and the science points to fasting as a **lifestyle**, not a passing fad.

**It's not normal to starve ourselves**

It's certainly not normal in our modern society. We have on-demand access to delicious food all day. **Our problems result more from excess, rather than scarcity**. What our bodies aren't physiologically used to is a constant deluge of calories and digestive strain from the time we wake right up until the time we sleep. This IV drip of calories contributes to a whole host of metabolic, weight, and neurological issues.

Before agriculture, it was [normal](https://www.inverse.com/article/57835-intermittent-fasting-evolution) to eat one or two meals a day (if that) and thus our bodies evolved the ability to tap into existing fat stores for energy. Society has advanced faster than our biology, and the truth is that fasting is closer to what our bodies are designed to do.

**It strains our bodies**

This is true. Fasting is pretty strenuous on the body, but that doesn't mean it's a bad thing. There is a potent hormonal cocktail of cortisol and adrenaline that is secreted when in a fasted state. This contributes to the mental acuity that many experience but is also stressful on the body and can contribute to insomnia during extended fasts.

High intensity interval training and weightlifting literally break down muscle fibers so they regrow stronger and denser than before. In a similar way, fasting trains your body to switch between glycogen and fat stores more efficiently, clean itself through autophagy, and better control its insulin response.

**I'm going to lose my muscle**

It just makes sense, doesn't it? If you don't eat, your body is going to have to eat itself to survive, right? The reality is more nuanced than that — it turns out that muscle gain / loss is mostly a function of [exercise](https://thefastingmethod.com/fasting-and-muscle-mass-fasting-part-14/). Sure, you need protein and calories to maintain muscle but your body has vast stores of this. Unless you have a low single digit body fat %, you'll likely be fine.

As I mentioned above, your body ramps up HGH production partially in order to [preserve muscle mass](https://thefastingmethod.com/fasting-and-muscle-mass-fasting-part-14/). If you're a hunter that hasn't eaten for days, it doesn't make sense to start off munchin' on the parts of your body that are most likely to contribute to a successful hunt, right?

**Isn't breakfast the most important meal of the day?**

Not quite... The literal definition of breakfast (the meal you break your fast with) is arguably the most important meal of the day, but the conventional definition that involves sugary cereal and overpriced coffee is not.

The notion of breakfast as "the most important meal of the day" was created by General Foods marketers in 1944 and other [cereal companies](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/06/how-marketers-invented-the-modern-version-of-breakfast/487130/) to, well, sell more cereal. Since then, there has been a lot of research [debunking](https://www.bmj.com/content/364/bmj.l42) these unsubstantiated findings.

The reality is that it is important to break your fast with nutritious, protein rich, and fibrous food[^6] — however you can probably ditch the 8am bowl of Lucky Charms.

## The Experience

I have notes / rants on multiple mediums (Zero, Roam, my memories, Mack) that I'm going to synthesize and share with you.

**Thursday**

We ate our last meal for the weekend on Thursday evening (dramatically dubbed The Final Supper), after we were all finished working for the day. The feast was a hodge podge mix of eggs, granola, and [extra fancy nuts](https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/Mixed_Nuts_in_the_Shell_Standard%5B1%5D.pdf). Afterwards, we scrawled our before weights onto the living room whiteboard, downed a motley of [electrolyte supplements](https://drinklmnt.com/blogs/health/electrolytes-while-fasting-benefits-and-best-sources) (sodium, magnesium, zinc, and potassium) and drifted off into a deep slumber.

{{< figure src="/article_images/fasting/last_supper.jpg" >}}

**Friday**

Friday morning wasn't terrible. I fast intermittently most days, so I knew the lay of the land up until ~2pm. Around then is when I started to feel weird. I think my body was adjusting to become more fat-adapted. Here are some notes I took during this time.

> *2:02p: Starting to feel a bit sluggish and distracted. My hunger is at about a 5/10, and was honestly much worse this morning.*
> *4:12p: It's been about 20 hours and I'm a little on edge right now. The closest analog that I can compare this to is the come up of a psychedelic.*

Around this time is also when Mack decided to [break her fast](https://littlecurrywurst.com/blog/fasting/) after the 24 hour mark, following some nausea and unsettling articles regarding the potential reproductive harms of fasting for women. That evening she made some fried eggs with avocado... The smells and sounds of the kitchen were tantalizing and I felt a strong desire to scarf down everything in the pantry. I felt the most hunger about 24 hours into the fast.

**Saturday**

I woke up around 8a Saturday morning and felt terrible. Low energy, fantasies of food, lack of sleep[^7], and a general malaise. I had what was anecdotally known as [keto flu](https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/keto/flu-side-effects), a state that feels similar to a sickness (though it's not contagious) resulting from the transition into a fat burning state. The flu didn't last forever though, and after some electrolytes and a [coffee](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28177691/) I felt better than ever.

We spent the afternoon doing chores and then went to Golden Gate Park for a few hours, soaking in the sights and the sun. We walked by many small bakeries and restaurants and even saw a man (1) drop some bread rolls on a questionable San Francisco sidewalk (2) curse at the sky and then (3) put the bread back in his brown paper bag. Respect.

I realized that past a certain point, the primary challenge of fasting was mental. My body would relish in burning through my fat stores for many days, though my mind would yearn for something to eat (especially when surrounding by the heavenly scent of bakeries). So much of society is built upon the primal act of eating or drinking — it's impossible to walk 5 minutes in a city without seeing a restaurant or store that sells food.

Mack and I discussed whether we would relinquish the biological necessity to eat if given the option (we both said no), saw a roller skating derby in the park, packed into a tweakin’ MUNI bus, and picked up a few massive but on sale avocados & pumpkin on the way back home. That evening I felt an incredible surge of mental energy and found myself in a deep state of focused flow. My body was tired, but my mind was as sharp as ever.

**Sunday**

{{< figure src="/article_images/fasting/tired_wired.png" >}}

Gooooooood morning! It was the final day of the fast and I couldn't believe I'd made it this long. I felt much better than the previous morning but was still dazed and sleep deprived. Tired and wired, indeed.

The entire day felt like a slow crescendo of hunger and excitement until **The Break** at 7p sharp that evening. The more I thought about it, the hungrier I would get. I needed to turn my mind away from food so as to not torture myself.

5p rolled around and we headed to Grocery Outlet to get food for the week and more importantly, a feast for the night. Reader, please do as I say, not as I do — because I did something not recommended after a 72 fast, which is eat everything in sight. Here's what was on the menu:

- Lemon water (half-cup)
- Bone broth (half-cup)
- Spicy tomato juice (half-cup)
- Salmon (~1/3 pound)
- Broccoli (~20)
- Eggs (2 over-easy)
- Avocado (half)
- Fancy nuts (a handful)
- Lemon meringue almonds (too many)
- Chocolate (a few pieces)
- Pumpkin spice protein bar (half)
- Coconut ice cream (...)

In aggregate, I estimate to have eaten 3000 calories in matter of two hours. As I'll mention more in the lessons section, this is not recommended. But you know what? I was proud of my accomplishment and decided to treat myself — who cares if I regretted it a few hours later? And with that, my first ever extended fast was officially over. It was an incredible experience but a literal roller coaster as you can see below.

{{< figure src="/article_images/fasting/zero_graph.png" >}}

## Lessons Learned

My general strategy (if you can even call it that) when trying something new is to throw myself into the fray. I schedule a time with an [‘accountability partner’](https://medium.com/@MaryLouWrites/accountability-partners-what-are-they-and-how-do-i-get-some-c5ebd1a828ef), do a sprint of research, and just let the experience unfold. After this, I like to reflect and distill the major lessons on how to improve the process in the future. Here is a combination of things I would do differently (1) before the fast (2) during the fast and (3) after the fast.

- Leading up to the fast I would **ease the body into being fat-adapted**. This is a combination of (1) sandwiching your fast with a few days of a keto diet before & after — which Dr. Peter Attia (health & longevity expert) calls [‘The Nothing Burger’](https://www.zerofasting.com/nutrition-in-the-new-year-fueling-your-fasts/) and (2) restricting your feeding window for a week leading up to the fast. Both of these help train your body & mind to function without food and get you into a fat-adapted state... *faster*.
- Related to above, once the fast is over, I would **break the fast with a lighter hand**. The Zero app [recommends](https://www.zerofasting.com/breaking-your-fast/) that you follow a layered approach, gradually working your way up to more complex food every few hours.
    - First, start with liquids such as broths or juices without sugar (to not strain the digestive system).
    - Gradually introduce foods that are low on the [glycemic index](https://www.daravinto.com/2020/03/18/control-your-blood-sugar-with-low-glycemic-index-food/) like eggs, avocados, and soft-cooked vegetables.
    - Transition slowly, with no more than ~500 calories every 2-3 hours while making sure to chew food thoroughly and eating something with probiotics to ease digestion.
- **Opt for salt pills or bullion instead of salt water**. The combination of Himalayan sea salt and lukewarm tap water is one of the most disgusting things I've ever tasted, even with flavor deprived taste buds. It's also difficult to gauge exactly how much salt water you should drink, while pills of salt or blocks of bullion are easier to measure out.
- One of the toughest parts of an extended fast is the lack of quality sleep. This is partially due to an increased adrenal & cortisol response that's keeping you alert in case a juicy caribou wanders by. In the future, I would **take additional supplements and employ strategies to help sleep**.
    - 100-600mg of [Phosphatidylserine](https://perfectketo.com/phosphatidylserine/) to calm the adrenal glands.
    - 1mg of Melatonin to help transition the body into a state of sleep.
    - [Blue light](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side) avoidance ~3-4 hours before bed.
    - No caffeine after 2pm.
    - Of course, the commonly recommended electrolytes like sodium, magnesium, and zinc at proper doses depending on your weight.

{{< figure src="/article_images/fasting/thot_in_bed.jpeg" >}}

- Some low-hanging fruit is to **not torture yourself**. This means staying away from food or anything that could remind you of food (especially from 2p - 6p which is typically peak hunger). This is difficult if you're around other people that aren't fasting but can be remedied by ample communication and staying away from delicious Italian bakeries.
- I started (and subsequently broke) my fast in the evening. This is just [one way](https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/5nkoyr/whens_the_best_time_of_the_day_to_start_you_fast/) of starting a fast. In the future, I would **experiment with different start-times**. For example, by starting in the morning, you could better time your break to ease back into a normal diet instead of stuffing your face at 8p like I did. The downside is that the first few days will be more difficult, but it's all about what works best for you.
- One travel strategy is to **fast on the plane**. One benefit is the premeditated decision to say no to the rubbery McChicken & milkshake at the airport. The other major benefit is a reduction in [jet lag](https://www.travelandleisure.com/trip-ideas/yoga-wellness/delayed-meal-times-jet-lag) — your circadian rhythm transitions better to a new time if you fast during the lag and begin eating according to the new time.
- To minimize hunger, I would **drink more coffee, green tea, and carbonated water**. I had a half-cup of black coffee in the mornings but mostly stayed away due to caffeine sensitivity — however that's what decaf is for. In addition, green tea has [catechins](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6076941/) which help liberate fatty acids from stores into the bloodstream while reducing hunger. Carbonated water can also reduce hunger and provide some textural diversity to fluid consumption.

## **Fasting Checklist**

- Mandatory electrolytes: 5000mg sodium, 1000mg potassium, 300mg magnesium.
- Optional supplements for sleep: 100-600mg phosphatidylserine, 1mg melatonin before bed.
- Drink plenty of water (still & carbonated) as well as black coffee or green tea to stave off hunger & help release ketones.
- Spend the week before slowly restricting your feeding window and reducing carb intake.
- After the fast, eat ~500 calories of easy-to-digest food every 2-3 hours — prepare this beforehand!

## **Conclusion**

Halfway through the fast, a friend sent me this:

{{< figure src="/article_images/fasting/reality_text.jpeg" >}}

Brilliant. I think I have seen through reality a bit more. We live in a tiny band of understanding, with the whole gamut of human experience just beyond our comfort zone. The unquestionable axioms we've been told about nutrition like the food pyramid's [carb heavy](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/eat-moderate-amount-of-carbs-for-health/) diet as the source of truth, the [necessity](https://www.webmd.com/diet/obesity/features/6_meals_a_day) of small meals throughout the day for weight loss, and the [demonization](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-truth-about-fats-bad-and-good) of all fats are just not true.

Fasting was one of the most difficult things that I've willingly put myself through. I'm in awe at the human body and its ability to withstand incredible pressures like this. I've never been one to take things at face value and fasting isn't any different. I'm excited and inspired by this experiment, and I will be repeating this many times in the future. I hope to do a similar fast every 3-4 months and continue to iterate on the process.

Stay ~~hungry~~ fasted, my friends. 🥑

Thank you so much for reading! This is the longest thing I've ever written, but I felt the subject deserved it. Have you ever considered fasting before? Is there anything that you know about it that I haven't mentioned in this piece? I would love to hear about it and connect on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nikhilthota)!

If you are interested in fasting, do research beforehand to figure out if it's something that could benefit you, and talk to a doctor to make sure you're not in a group that would be negatively affected. In addition, I recommend downloading the [Zero](https://www.zerofasting.com/) app by Dr. Peter Attia. It's free[^8], has a beautiful timer, well-researched articles, and fasting meditations.

Shoutout to the roommates (& honorary roommate) [Tyler](http://www.tylerjrichards.com/), [Kenton](https://twitter.com/kentonprescott), and [Mack](https://littlecurrywurst.com/) for sharing this experience with me, and to Macc, Jess, [Spencer](https://www.spencerchang.me/), and Kenton for looking at drafts of this!

[^1]: One of the most common misconceptions in longevity is conflating lifespan and healthspan. Many people I've talked to don't care to improve longevity because they don't want to live longer as a decrepit geezer. What these people are referring to is lifespan, which is only one part of the longevity equation. Healthspan on the other hand, is more a function of how good and healthy you feel while you're alive. A 100 year old with heart problems and dementia has a great lifespan with a poor healthspan, while an 80 year old that's in great shape and runs marathons has slightly less lifespan, but much higher healthspan. **Fasting has been shown to improve both lifespan and healthspan**, helping you live a longer and healthier life. Dr. Attia describes the distinction [here](https://peterattiamd.com/move-defines-live/).

[^2]: This reduction in inflammation might be because everybody else in the western world is eating too much — there's a good chance that fasting just gives our metabolic processes some much needed rest. [Over 40%](https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html) of Americans are obese, which leads to a whole host of metabolic issues. This is an unfortunate confluence of factors like the unhealthy
[Standard American Diet](https://www.uab.edu/inquiro/issues/past-issues/volume-9/82-the-effects-of-an-american-diet-on-health) (SAD 😢), excessive convenience and comfort, and lack of consistent & accurate health information.

[^3]: Yes, fasting can even help the treatment of [cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6938162/). The exact mechanism is still unknown but autophagy seems to play a large role. In addition, there is promising [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4836034/) indicating that autophagy inhibits viral replication of what have typically been lifelong neurological diseases like HSV (cold sores). [I have no idea what’s happening in this image but I love it.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=4836034_kaup-12-03-1139262-g001.jpg)

[^4]: Unfortunately, fasting can obstruct reproductive processes. Creating a child demands a lot of energy, so the body needs to know it has enough in reserve. Mack explains it with more eloquence in her [piece](https://littlecurrywurst.com/blog/fasting/).

[^5]: Here are a few gut-checks for my views presented in this piece, expressed in terms of probabilities. **95%** chance that 16:8 IF daily extends lifespan over no IF with daily Lucky Charms consumption. **5%** chance that in 20 years, we’ll realize that fasting is a bad idea. **90%** chance that I’ll be on this same (or more restrictive) fasting regimen in a year. **0%** chance that I’m completely correct about everything in this here. 😅

[^6]: Some of my favorite breakfast foods are eggs, avocado, oatmeal, nuts, fresh fruit, and [falafel bowl](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/mediterranean-falafel-bowl/).

[^7]: There is an evolutionary reason for this reduction in sleep. The primitive human in a fasted state needed to be alert at all times. It was a life or death situation that would determine the tribe's next meal.

[^8]: Zero also has a premium version with get a 7-day free trial during your first extended fast. Definitely try it out, but I find the free version to be enough for my needs.
