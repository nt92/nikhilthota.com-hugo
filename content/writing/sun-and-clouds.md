{{< pullquote quote="Imagine that we live where it's always cloudy. We never see the sun. And we, of course, take our everyday experience as if it's reality—the only reality. The clouds are perhaps a little claustrophobic in some vague way but they're comfortable and familiar. One day we meet a visitor who tells us that what we're used to isn't the whole story, that there's something else. Curious, we go with him, and he guides us up a mountain. We climb up and up, through the cloud cover. There, at the top, we step into this incredible intense experience of sun and expansive sky. It completely changes our sense of what's possible, what's available to us. We return to our daily lives, but we'll never be the same." author="Bruce Tift in Already Free" source="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25656467-already-free">}}

***Mission District, San Francisco. 6:48pm. 67° F.***

It looks like a gorgeous day outside. I throw my phone on my bed, and grab my keys and face mask. *"What a world we live in"*, I think as I walk down the flight of stairs to my front door. I get a pleasant whiff of lightly smoked charcoal as I step into the outside world. After five minutes of walking, I stop at Precita Park and take a nice, long look at the scampering puppies to the right of me.

**Focus**.

I'm on somewhat of a *mission*, if you could call it that. It's not urgent, but it is important. My mission will not directly change the world too much, but it will fundamentally change my relationship to the world.

I walk another few minutes south on Folsom Street and notice the route transitioning into an incline. It's not a comfortable trek by any means, but it is meditative and calming. Nothing more than a scuffle between me and gravity. I continue upwards and reach the brow of the hill, seeing the [Oakland AT-ATs](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Nah-dude-they-weren-t-cranes-they-were-garbage-3279459.php) poking out in the distance. There's now many more people, circling the base of the next hill—some with friends and dogs, others with dri-fit attire and Apple Watches.

My mission isn't done yet. I'm only halfway there. I walk along the perimeter of the hill and find a stairway that leads me to the top. After dodging a few more left hooks thrown by gravity, I have at last made it to the top of the Bernal Heights. The city lights glisten in the distance as the sun sets.

7:14pm. *"Not too bad"* I think to myself. The journey took less than half an hour. I sit down and feel a deep sense of warmth and peace envelop me. *Good thing, these winds are unforgiving*. As the last tendrils of sunlight depart their posts, I too say goodbye. I walk back to my apartment, satisfied and content to have showed up once again.
