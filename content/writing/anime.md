## What Makes an Anime Good?

> “Quality ... you know what it is, yet you don't know what it is. But that's self-contradictory. But some things are better than others, that is, they have more quality. But when you try to say what the quality is, apart from the things that have it, it all goes poof! ... What the hell is Quality? What is it?”
