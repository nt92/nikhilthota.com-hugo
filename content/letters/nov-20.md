Hello to my (checks mailing list) 29 subscribers! **Welcome to the first edition of Thot's Thoughts**. My intention with this *monthly* newsletter is to (1) reflect on the month's events and distill major lessons into a few digestible themes (2) serve as a forcing function for me to create more than I consume and of course (3) provide value to my *many* subscribers.

This is still an experiment but here is how I intend to structure each newsletter (after a brief meta-update on the newsletter itself):

1. **Personal Update**: Self explanatory. A little update on what I've been up to.
2. **Artifacts**: Creations that I've shared in the past month. This could be blog posts, talks, prototypes, or even tweets that I'm proud of.
3. **Life Reflections**: Pretty broad category, but this is for things that I've learned about *life* that could be valuable to share — think family, relationships, hobbies, finding lasting satisfaction, and the other nitty-gritty parts of being a human.
4. **Career Reflections**: Equally broad but orthogonal to life, as far as my reflections are concerned. Eventually I hope to harmoniously merge my career and life but for now, I'll use this section to talk about what I've learned about *work*.
5. **Personal Experiments**: I love being a guinea pig for my own experiments. This is where I'll talk about what experiment(s) I'm currently running, my gleanings, and what I plan to test out in the following month.
6. **Best Finds**: Dear reader if you manage to slurp the marrow out of this newsletter and make it to the end, you'll find the delicious nectar of life presented for dessert. These are 5 blog posts, books, songs, podcasts, whatever from the past month that really resonated with me.

*A note on forcing functions. Outside of differential calculus, a forcing function is an activity that forces you to take action and produce a result. It's the pressure that can turn a lumpy piece of coal like myself into a shiny diamond. By being on the hook to publish a novel newsletter every month, I will be forced to create artifacts rather than consume them, think more critically about the events in my life & career, follow through with my own personal experiments, and be more intentional about the content that I absorb and subsequently share.*

Also — shoutout to the hometown homie Carl for creating the beautiful banner for this newsletter (and my profile icon). You can check out his work [here](https://instagram.com/jungaboon) and [here](https://www.artofcarl.com/).

## 🗺 Personal Update

Earlier in the month, I flew back to Florida to spend the holidays with my family. I'll be here until early January, marking the longest contiguous period I've spent with my family since graduating high school. I know, I'm a little nervous too.

## 📝 Artifacts

A few weeks ago, I gave a [presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nNy8cjiBG4tFkM7vUMmpYmwo2tAb6V7n/view) to my little sister's 4th grade class for the Great American Teach-In (remember that?) over Zoom about my job at Facebook. It was very wholesome.

I found some time to write during the holidays and got out this piece exploring the different [forms of reading](https://nikhilthota.com/writing/multimodal-reading/).

I also wrote a [goodreads review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3608007735) for a short and inspiring book that is jam-packed with information on *learning how to learn* called Ultralearning.

## 🌊 Life Reflections

My roommates and I signed a lease for a new apartment in San Francisco just a few blocks down from our current spot. I'll be trading out a private bathroom for much more space, cheaper rent, and a sushi shop right below us! 🍣

The search for this place was a stark contrast to the stressful experience we had when we first moved to San Francisco. The SF housing bubble was in full effect Summer 2019 and we had to coordinate an apartment hunt from three different continents. Credit reports in hand, we viewed many sub-par places that got scooped up faster than we could submit the Intellirent application. Finding the cute, relatively cheap, and well situated flat that we dubbed Sweet Home Alabama was a stroke of luck.

Since the start of 2020, rents in SF have dropped [> 20%](https://www.zumper.com/blog/rental-price-data/) and after throwing around a few feelers on Zumper, we realized we had the upper hand. After our old landlord uh ... [got arrested (?)](https://antievictionmap.com/anne-kihagi-ana-swain) the property managers were slow on the draw to offer a lower rent, prompting our search. There were many beautiful properties *on sale* but we were spoiled from seeing all the talk on Twitter of tanking rent prices. Eventually we found our current place that checked *most* of our boxes and will be moving in early 2021. 🎉

## 🤓 Career Reflections

Work this month has been rough. I was lucky enough to find a comfortable work-life groove when Covid19 started ravaging the world but that's recently changed. A convergence of deadlines, looming performance evaluations, and my attempt to get promoted this half have led to some 60+ hour work weeks.

Things have since calmed down but I can see the baton being passed my way for the end-of-year scramble. That's one thing I've learned about working at a (large) company — **it's a series of sprints followed by downtime**. The nature and cadence of these are largely out of your control, but the writing is on the wall... It's clear when it's coming and you should prepare accordingly.

## 🥑 Personal Experiments

The biggest (and most difficult) experiment from this past month was going **7 days without caffeine**. I've had some level of caffeine nearly every day for the past year and this was my attempt at curbing that dependence and facing some demons. Here are a few thoughts from each day:

- Day 1: No headaches, just more sluggish than usual. I generally have most of my caffeine with theanine, which is likely helping negate the withdrawal symptoms.
- Day 2: Felt much better this day. After pushing through the initial ~15 minutes of resistance towards doing something slightly difficult, I was able to get into a flow state. Pretty mind-blowing that I don't need to tweak myself out to get here.
- Day 3: I had my first (virtual) social interaction since starting! S/O [Kchow](http://kchow.org/). I think people use caffeine (and alcohol) to mask the initial awkwardness of talking to other people. After getting into the groove of conversation, it was like nothing was missing.
- Day 4: Slowly but surely realizing that having the energy to do everything that you want to do is a combination of (1) sleep (2) diet and (3) exercise. Caffeine is used to mask a deficiency in one of these pillars. *Rocket Science*.
- Day 5: A lumpy day caused by < 6 hours of sleep and too many chips led to a lot of temptation to break my detox and just have a cup of something. I ain't break it tho.
- Day 6: I felt stellar! The lulls throughout the day (usually after meals) still happen, but it seems like my energy levels are [more stable](https://twitter.com/jborichevskiy/status/1328492262527885312).
- Day 7: My last day. I think I want to do this more regularly. After a couple of weird days I'm back to baseline and I have reset my [adenosine receptors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3153505/). I think a ~quarterly cadence bookended by an extended fast and a psychedelic experience would be prime.

Next month I'm tackling something in a... different vein. **I'm going to use Twitter more**. No, you read correctly. I'm going to willingly subject myself to the sugar rush of Twitter with a bias towards creation over consumption. I've always had an unhealthy relationship with Twitter, either binging for hours or just deleting the app. What if there's a happy in-between where I could share my ideas with the broader community but not get sucked into the toxicity? That's what we're going to find out! Stay tuned.

## 🍯 Best Finds (nectar of life?)

Dave Chappelle appeared on Dav~~e~~id Letterman's [Netflix show](https://www.netflix.com/watch/81228413) and the name doesn't lie. Chappelle needs no introduction. It's a tender hour as Chappelle shows Letterman around his hometown in rural Ohio, reaffirming the value of local community.

Kanye West and Joe Rogan are both pretty polarizing figures but a [conversation together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxOeWuAHOiw) is an enjoyable 3 hours. I love that Kanye basically interviews himself, and seeing his mind toy with multiple ideas and eventually resolve them all into a *symphony of thought* is just brilliant.

[Dissect](https://dissectpodcast.com/) is an original serialized podcast from Spotify that analyzes a hip-hop artist every season. Season 7 was an analysis of Childish Gambino's 2013 *Because The Internet*. I loved this album when it was released but was completely unaware of the intricate multimedia canvas that Donald Glover was painting on, blurring the lines between reality and fiction.

[Saib](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6N4HlHINMvoTyAL0yhBUCk) is a lofi artist from Morocco that I recently discovered. I'll let his Spotify description speak for itself — *Hip hop beats form the backbone as saib.’s musical palette skips from jazz flavors to lounge experiments to Asian textures … and sometimes within a single track.*

[Kapil Gupta](https://twitter.com/kapilguptamd) is a writer, thinker, and advisor to high performers whose work I've been devouring. He's devoted to the Truth in all things — which is evident in the directness and no-nonsense nature of his [writing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40947505-direct-truth) and [podcast appearances](https://podofjake.com/2020/10/13/15-kapil-gupta/).

That's it folks, see you on Jan. 1st 2021! I'd love to hear what resonated or what fell flat in this first edition. **Was this actually valuable to you?** Just reply to this email or message me — I personally know all of y'all anyways. ✌️
