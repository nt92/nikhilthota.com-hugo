Hello reader and welcome to 2021! Before we get into it, here are a few *meta* housekeeping things.

- I'm adding season & episode numbers. I was inspired by [this article](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/newsletter-seasons/), which argues that the metaphor of the season (1) provides the newsletter a sense of *going somewhere,* (2) gives me the option to pause & reflect between seasons, and (3) affords me the flexibility to evolve the newsletter in a structured way.
- I also realized that I don't need to publish exactly on the first day of the month. I'll make sure the monthly cadence is maintained, but there's no need to be so precise with the timing.

## üó∫ Personal Update

I've spent the past 6 weeks with my family in Florida. As I send this out, I'm en route to San Francisco. I'm spending the next few weeks there, getting situated into my new apartment (The Precita Pad?), and then am hopefully heading to Hawaii. *More on that next month*...

## üé® Artifacts

I wrote a [piece](https://nikhilthota.com/writing/fasting/) blending the science of fasting with my experience doing a 72 hour fast. It's useful for anyone hoping to try fasting and has some... entertaining drawings.

I recently read [Hell Yeah or No](https://sive.rs/n) by Derek Sivers and wrote a [Goodreads review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3463642689) and a [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/nikhilthota/status/1341877666161541120) about it. Overall it's entertaining, short, and inspiring ‚Äî highly recommend.

Finally, I gave a *brown bag* talk to my coworkers on the wonders of ergonomics. The video of the presentation is behind a corporate firewall, but here's a [thread](https://twitter.com/nikhilthota/status/1344298593814007809) summarizing my favorite ideas and some actionable steps.

## üåä Life Reflections

I have a 9 year old sister. One of the main reasons I choose to spend months with family is to be there as she grows up. It's been a joy watching her develop a personality of her own and soak up my unfortunate mannerisms. As she gets older, I've noticed my parents push her to be more *grown up* ‚Äî to them, this means being more responsible and aware of the world around her.

This is all good, but it feels like the wrong way to go about it. Childhood is depicted by society as an idyllic time that ends at *adulthood* AKA a job and responsibilities. Most *"adults"* are stressed and busy all the time while most children are immersed in the moment and overflowing with spontaneous joy. *Who should be learning from whom?*

The question I've been pondering: **Is it possible to be a responsible and well-adjusted adult while maintaining the innate creativity, spontaneity, and joy of a child?** My intuition says yes, and I can think of countless creatives throughout history that have turned their work into play. **What do you think?**

Lol. See y'all next month.

## ü•ë Personal Experiments

My experiment this past month was to use Twitter more. A few days into it, I [realized](https://twitter.com/nikhilthota/status/1337089520328728577) that the key was to ignore hesitation and post whatever I felt like. I got over my stage fright but ran into another problem... *Twitter is supremely addicting*. If I checked it first thing in the morning, I would reflexively open the app every time my focus wavered throughout the day. It has an extraordinary grip on my attention, and I found myself running into my 20 min screen time bumpers constantly. I tried a few things to combat this, and lean towards creation over consumption.

- **Draft tweets outside the app**. When I had an idea for a tweet, I would draft it *outside* of the app so I had clarity to think about it and not get sucked into the ever-enticing feed.
- **Turn off push notifications**. This didn't help. I found myself opening the app when bored, salivating for those sweet blue circles.
- **Put some 'Twitter time' on your calendar**. I know... This is very nerdy. However, scheduling 30 minutes daily to read / write tweets really helped build the habit of actually using the app more. Once it became a habit, my 'Twitter time' block got ignored and I was hooked.

Overall, I've enjoyed this experiment and will continue to use Twitter. I feel more connected to the ideas of the Twittersphere and have had some cool interactions. One of my favorite writers, Derek Sivers, even replied to a thread I wrote about his book and followed me! ü§Ø

In January 2021, I'm going to... [breathe less](https://www.bcia.org/files/public/CE%20Articles/36_2biof_summer_buteyko_breathing.pdf)? I've been deep in some biomechanical rabbit holes and recently stumbled upon Dr. Konstantin Buteyko. He was a Russian physician who created the Buteyko Method for the treatment of asthma, sleep apnea, and other breathing disorders. It turns out that on average, people breathe 2-3x more than they should, leading to excess oxidative stress. Even people without breathing disorders [have reported](https://www.reddit.com/r/buteyko/) some remarkable benefits like higher energy levels throughout the day, needing less sleep, etc. when following the Buteyko principles.

Is all of this just hype / placebo? Maybe. Are there any medical studies that validate these glowing anecdotal reports of increased vitality? Kind of. Am I going to spend this month finding out whether it's legit? Hell yeah! I'm a sucker for this stuff. Stay tuned...

## üçØ Best Finds (nectar of life?)

üìù [**The Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant** by *Nick Bostrom*](https://www.nickbostrom.com/fable/dragon.html) This 2005 allegory confronts the timeless conflict between complacency and the advancement of society. I'll let you discover the moral for yourself.

üìù [**LinkedIn's Alternative Universe** by *Fadeke Adegbuyi*](https://divinations.substack.com/p/linkedins-alternate-universe/) LinkedIn is bizarre. It has tons of quirks and features that make you confused, annoyed, and intrigued at the same time. I found myself laughing and nodding in cringed agreement to this piece.

üìù [**An Island, Vegas, Budapest for A Fraction of the Median House Price** by *Tynan*](https://tynan.com/empire/) This guy has figured out co-ownership of property (an island, a set of shared flats, and a small neighborhood) with friends. If done with the right people and system, the experience is far from a Lord of the Flies dystopia. Rather, it becomes an empowering, meaningful, and financially effective way of sharing resources with friends. I wonder if there's opportunity to do this at scale üëÄ

üìπ [**Learn Mathematics from START to FINISH** by *The Math Sorcerer*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTnEG_WGd2Q) The Math Sorcerer's passion for math is truly infectious. I would love to (attempt to) do an [Ultralearning project](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3608007735) over the course of a year, poring through the Sorcerer's recommendations.

## üëãüèΩ Thanks 2020, Adi√≥s

This past year has been one helluva [dumpster fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9ZdL0j8QGA), but there have been many things keeping me optimistic with regards to science & technological progress. Here are a few of my favorites to close out this newsletter with.

- For the first time ever, a private company (SpaceX) sent a [staffed crew](https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/30/spacex-makes-history-with-successful-first-human-space-launch/) into space. With space travel [25x cheaper](https://theconversation.com/how-spacex-lowered-costs-and-reduced-barriers-to-space-112586) than it was just 20 years ago, space tourism, asteroid mining, and interplanetary settlements are looking less like a Sci-Fi fever dream and more like reality.
- Solar energy is also more accessible than ever, with the costs [dropping every year](https://rameznaam.com/2020/05/14/solars-future-is-insanely-cheap-2020/). In sunny parts of the world, the cost of solar is now cheaper than that of fossil fuels ‚Äî this means that there will soon be an *immediate* economic incentive to switch to renewable energy.
- OpenAI unveiled [GPT-3](https://www.theverge.com/21346343/gpt-3-explainer-openai-examples-errors-agi-potential), a text completion system, which had the primary effect of [taking twitter by storm](https://analyticsindiamag.com/openai-gpt-3-model-machine-learning-products/), and the secondary effect of showing us what *exponential growth* in the field of Artificial Intelligence really means.
- Another AI advancement was Google DeepMind's [AlphaFold](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03348-4), which has effectively solved an aspect of one of Biology's biggest problems ‚Äî protein folding. It allows Biologists to more accurately understand the shapes of proteins. This opens a lot of doors in drug discovery, genetics, and medicine.
- Some scientists injected cells into optic nerves and were able to [reverse ageing](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03119-1) in the eyes. This caused optic cells to become younger and restored vision in mice.
- Google also made headlines late last year with its stake on [Quantum Supremacy](https://www.wired.com/story/quantum-computing-here-but-not-really/) ‚Äî a designation given to a quantum machine that can do something strictly better than a conventional computer. Then, late this year... China [staked its claim](https://www.wired.com/story/china-stakes-claim-quantum-supremacy/) with different technology that can perform certain computations 100,000,000,000,000 faster than a normal supercomputer.
- Finally, in under a year, companies like Pfizer and [Moderna](https://www.modernatx.com/modernas-work-potential-vaccine-against-covid-19) created & got approval for vaccines during the biggest pandemic in a century. The logistical hurdles overcome by the US Government via [Project Warp Speed](https://www.defense.gov/Explore/Spotlight/Coronavirus/Operation-Warp-Speed/) are also outstanding.
