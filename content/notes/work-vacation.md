[This was originally posted on my Hawaii Travel Journal.](/writing/fears/)

Our first few days in Kona were standard. We got some morning coffee, I rolled into work at 7am, grinded out some code, and clocked out by 3pm. The evenings were filled with walks, historic sites [(more on hawaiian history here)](https://tinyletter.com/nikhilthota/letters/s01-e03-the-sandwich-islands), and sunsets by the small beach near our Airbnb known as *"Keiki Beach Queen's Bath"*.

By merging the energies of work and life in this way, I've realized that I genuinely enjoy working on meaningful projects while on vacation. It sounds counterproductive, but I find it difficult to fully disconnect for over 3 days without getting restless. I like being able to choose this lifestyle, and it might be that choice that makes all the difference. Over the course of a week, here's how I'd like to spend a vacation:

- 3-4 days of intense & focused work on something meaningful (for no more than 6 hours per day)
- Evenings and a long weekend of exploration, physical activity, time spent with loved ones, hobbies, and curiosity-driven learning

I like to blend my vacations with meaningful work and balance the polarities of being ["On and Off"](https://ava.substack.com/p/on-and-off). The conventional notion of a *"vacation"* in which you work intensely for several months and then chill by a beach resort with cocktails for a week just doesn't appeal to me. After being *"on"* for so long, it takes a while to turn *"off"* if you're not regularly exercising that skill. I'd much rather shorten the feedback loop by going hard for a few days at a time, fully relaxing for a bit, and then getting back at it. Eventually, I hope to turn this ideal vacation lifestyle into my everyday existence.
