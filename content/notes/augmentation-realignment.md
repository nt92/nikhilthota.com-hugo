A conversation with the right person, at the right time, and around the right topic is invigorating. When you're running on fumes and about to abandon a project, this person can jolt you back into excitement, as if you were just struck by a bolt of lightning.

Conversely, the same topic discussed with someone else in a different frame of mind can realign your perspective, helping you unearth truths buried under layers of sunk-cost.

Both are good at the right times and in the right doses, and it's up to you to know who to go to for what.
