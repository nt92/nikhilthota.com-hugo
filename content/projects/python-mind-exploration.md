A few months ago at a random Chinatown bar in New York City, [Tyler Richards](http://www.tylerjrichards.com/)¬†and I were having a conversation about journaling. I told him that I had over 4¬†*years*¬†worth of consistent journal entries and Tyler, being the data-minded person he is, gave me an idea to reinforce the lessons and insights from these journaling sessions.

**The Idea**: A system that emails me a random journal entry every day so I could see exactly what was going on in my mind at that given time.

**The Data**: 600+ journal entries with content length ranging from cool 1-liners to 3 pages of word vomit

My journal entries are very free-form and stream-of-consciousness so I‚Äôm not totally sure if I‚Äôll end up learning anything useful, but I was curious to find out. The first step? Create a database to hold all of my journal entries.

## 1. Creating the Database

Holding all of my entries in a way that could be easily & efficiently accessed while also providing me the flexibility to add new entries if needed, SQLite was the tool for the job. This [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pd-0G0MigUA)¬†provides a good introduction to understanding how to create and query a local SQLite database with Python.

## 2. Convert my Google Doc files into usable data

The next step was aggregating all of my Google Doc files so that I could go through all of them with a script to extract all entries. Thankfully, I had some semblance of organization with which I separated entries ‚Äî before each entry, I have a date. Sometimes it‚Äôs¬†*mm/dd/yy*, sometimes *dd/mm/yy* if I thought I was cool for being in Europe, but there was always a date.

Once I had all of my files in a folder, I had to figure out how to go through each file and extract every entry. After reading this lovely [post](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-extract-data-from-ms-word-documents-using-python-ed3fbb48c122), I decided to go with the [docx](https://python-docx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)¬†Python library to read each file paragraph-by-paragraph and create a new entry in my database every time I ran into a new date.

*This shows how I am going through each file and extracting every individual entry based on whether I run into a pattern matching my date formats*

## 3. Send out a random entry every day

The next step was figuring how to send myself an email with an entry that was fetched from the database created earlier. This [guide](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/code-snippets-source-code/using-python-to-send-email/)¬†went through that process, which is surprisingly easy!

The final step was scheduling a recurring task that would run this code every morning automatically. Thankfully, Mac has a built-in system for this called [crontab](https://ole.michelsen.dk/blog/schedule-jobs-with-crontab-on-mac-osx.html).¬†*One issue I ran into was that crontab tasks only run when the computer is active. This was fixed by waking my laptop a minute before the 10am slot when the job was scheduled to run, detailed [here](https://superuser.com/questions/14836/crontab-to-wake-osx-from-sleep).*

All in all, I learned how to work with local SQLite databases, use Python to leverage data, and schedule recurring tasks on Mac.¬†**Cool**. So what now? I‚Äôm going to spend the next couple of months reading a random journal entry daily while traveling to see if I can glean any unique insights from my ramblings.

See you on the other side and stay tuned for my analysis ü§ôüèΩ
