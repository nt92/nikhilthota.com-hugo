## What is this?

This is a fun project that I'm working on to ramp up on Web3 development. It's essentially a website where people can "wave" at me and have these waves recorded on the blockchain (specifically the Rinkeby Eth testnet). This is based on a project from [Buildspace](https://buildspace.so/).

As this was my first Web3 project, there were a *lot* of learnings along the way — here's a rough order of how things got to the way they are:

  1. Set up Ethereum development environment with [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and then ran a contract to make sure it worked.
  2. Created a smart contract that will store who has *waved* at me, and how many times they've done so — this information is pulled directly from the blockchain and displayed on the site.
  3. Afterwards, the contract was deployed to the Rinkeby testnet [here](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xacb8DE7370D017d04f3999e93Cc8A088fD439169).
  4. Then, I made the frontend in React which uses some libraries to connect to Metamask (s/o `window.ethereum`) and call the deployed contract.
  5. Hosting is done on Replit for ease of development and so that we can spin up a web server on the fly that points to the output, which is done with the lightweight `vite` library.
  6. ...

## Technology
* `React` for frontend 
* `Replit` for webserver & hosting
* `Web3.js` for connecting webapp to blockchain
* `Alchemy` for deploying the smart contract
* `Solidity` for smart contract development
* `Hardhat` for eth dev environment

## How it Works
  
Well, a video would probably explain that pretty well wouldn't it?

If you want to interact with the [live site](https://chain-of-waves.nikhilthota.repl.co/), you can do the following:

1. Set up Metamask (plenty of online tutorials)
2. Switch to the Rinkeby testnet
3. Get some Rinkeby ETH (not real $) from a [faucet](https://faucets.chain.link/rinkeby)
4. Wave at me!

## TODO

I've still got a few more things I want to add before I finish up this project:
* Fund a contract to randomly send a waver some Eth
* Explore defensive mechanisms to prevent spam
